                  The main purpose of the newly adopted concept of freedom–negative liberty, proposed by Isaiah Berlin—assumes the stability of the current condition, whatever that may be in terms of the vicissitudes of perception. The notion that if a society were to adopt logical positivism in accordance to negative liberty and Ayn Rand’s Objectivism, the result of which is simultaneous prosperity for all, is antithetical to the concept of society as a communal organic manifestation of being “humane”. In simpler terms; the intertwining of uncertainty and selfish desires in a community as a whole defies its definition. Nevertheless, all are entitled to their affiliations.

                  In 1991, a survey conducted by the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club, ranked Atlas Shrugged as the second most influential book(Fein, 1991). Does this mean that 252,153,000 Americans(U.S. Census Bureau, 2000) were directly influenced by Rand’s philosophy? No.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  The survey was sent to 5000 Book-of-the-Month Club members; 2032 responded(Fein, 1991). That is approximately 0.008% of the population. It is imperative to take into account the sample size of any study. So, let us assume that one of the 2032 members who responded with “Atlas Shrugged influenced my life to the extent that I am now a follower of Objectivism” finally personified Rand’s “heroic” character. Better yet, what if a policy maker was influenced by Rand and acted upon it? What if that person, in his/her own twisted logic rationalised a vile act as “one’s attempt to reach happiness” by means of selfishness. Although the speculative nature of the latter inquires have no merit due to the “assumption” factor, the merging of Objectivisim and politics is destructive; it can only survive if the population governed by the system are all followers of the same school of thought(Iff such “optimistic” vision adheres to the will of all). Meaning, that any hint or even the slightest consideration of altruism—if Objectivisim was the school of thought–will tumble the system. The reason for mentioning the survey is imperative due to its confirmation of individualism—to some—as the “logical” approach to life.

                  If our aim is to better ourselves, overcoming selfishness is a step in the right direction.
